# Qualtrics

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```
## Overview

There are two tasks covered in this section: **1)** importing surveys into Qualtrics and **2)** moving data from Qualtrics to R. An overview of each process is below.

**1. Importing items into Qualtrics**

* Create a survey codebook in Excel (or similar program) that has each item and the response options for it
* Convert the survey codebook to Qualtrics [Advanced Text Format](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-tools/import-and-export-surveys/)
* Import the items
* Tweak the survey after import

**2. Qualtrics Data to R**

* Export the raw data from Qualtrics with maximal information in the data file
* Load the raw data into R
* Convert the raw data to analytic data. This conversion includes: assigning values to response options (e.g., "Strongly Disagree" becomes the value 1), flipping response for reverse-worded (i.e., reverse-key) items, and creating scale scores.

The overall steps are quite simple and I walk you through each step in detail below.

## Items to Qualtrics

There are two approaches to entering survey items into Qualtrics.

* Enter the items one at a time using the Qualtrics web interface.

* Create a text file using Qualtrics [Advanced Text Format](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-tools/import-and-export-surveys/) and import the times. Be warned though a bit of tweaking is often still needed using the web interface.

Here we focus only on the second approach to entering items into Qualtrics.

### Create survey codebook

We want to create a survey that contains 2 demographics items, 18 commitment items, and 4 job satisfaction items. To do we create a survey codebook spreadsheet in Excel (or similar program). The spreadsheet should have the columns block, item_name, item_text, type, response_options. The completed file is illustrated below  [survey_codebook.csv](survey_codebook.csv) file. Although you can see the information that should be in each column based of the figure I provide a detailed information of what should be placed in each column. Remember to work from the guiding principle that one row is use for one item/question.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ch_qualtrics/images/screenshot_items.png")
```

#### block column

Enter any text you wish to use as a label for a block of items.

#### item_name column

To make your life easier down the road, it is critical you set up your spreadsheet or online survey such that it uses a naming convention prior to data collection. Recall the [naming convention from the previous chapter](https://dstanley4.github.io/psyc6060bookdown/an-emphasis-on-workflow.html#naming-conventions).


#### item_text column

The item_text column contains the text for each item. Note that if you use commas in your item text do not save this file as a .csv file - it will not work. Rather save it as .tsv file (tab separated values). Then use read_tsv command instead of the read_csv command in the code that follows later.


#### type column

| Code for type column | Qualtrics Item Type | Additional Information  |
|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| matrix               | matrix     | If the first item in a block has type *matrix* all items in the block will be used to constucts the matrix question. **Unfortunately, importing item_names for matrix questions is not supported by Qualtrics. You will need to manually restore your item_names following the directions below for matrix items.** |
| MC                   | multiple choice vertical format  |  |
| MC_horizonal         | multiple choice horizontal format  |  |
| MC_multi_horizonal   | multiple choice horizontal format multiple answers |  |
| MC_select            | select box |  |
| MC_multi_select      | select multiple boxes     |  |
| MC_dropdown          | dropdown   |  |



#### response_options column

The Likert items for the different blocks use different response options. The commitment items use a 7-point response option and the job satisfaction items use a 5-point response option.

##### Year of birth

We used a number of response options to indicate Year of Birth. We entered them as per below. Each response option is separated by a semi-colon. Each of the years below will be in the dropdown button.

**Entered in the response_option column as below. Each option separated by a semicolon.**

1940;1941;1942;1943;1944;1945;1946;1947;1948;1949;1950;1951;1952;1953;1954;1955;1956;1957;1958;1959;1960;1961;1962;1963;1964;1965;1966;1967;1968;1969;1970;1971;1972;1973;1974;1975;1976;1977;1978;1979;1980;1981;1982;1983;1984;1985;1986;1987;1988;1989;1990;1991;1992;1993;1994;1995;1996;1997;1998;1999;2000;2001;2002;2003;2004;2005;2006;2007;2008;2009;2010

##### Sex 3 points

**Entered in the response_option column as below. Each option separated by a semicolon.**

males; female; intersex


##### Commitment 7 points

**Entered in the response_option column as below. Each option separated by a semicolon.**

Strongly Disagree;Moderately Disagree;Slightly Disagree;Neither Agree nor Disagree;Slightly Agree;Moderately Agree;Strongly Agree

##### Job Satisfaction 5 points

**Entered in the response_option column as below. Each option separated by a semicolon.**

Strongly Disagree; Disagree; Neutral; Agree; Strongly Agree

### Convert to Qualtrics format

#### Create TXT file

Once you have the survey codebook above, you need to convert it to an [Advanced Text Format](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-tools/import-and-export-surveys/) .txt file. We can do so by following the steps below.

##### RStudio on your computer
1. Create a folder on your computer called "new_survey" with the survey_codebook.csv file in it.

2. Open RStudio. Then go to File > New Project...

3.  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(qualtricsMaker)

survey_codebook <- read_csv("survey_codebook.csv",
                            show_col_types = FALSE)

make_survey(survey_codebook,
            filename = "items_qualtrics_format.txt")
```


##### RStudio Cloud

1. Open a new project

2. Ensure you ave installed the packages specified above by typing the commands below into the RStudio Cloud Console (not the script window).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse", dep = TRUE)
install.packages("janitor", dep = TRUE)
install.packages("remotes", dep = TRUE)
```

Then install the qualtricsMaker package from GitHub:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("dstanley4/qualtricsMaker")
```

3. Import the [survey_codebook.csv](survey_codebook.csv) file by using the Import button in the Files tab in the lower right panel.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ch_qualtrics/images/screenshot_import_button.png")
```




```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(qualtricsMaker)

survey_codebook <- read_csv("survey_codebook.csv",
                            show_col_types = FALSE)

make_survey(survey_codebook,
            filename = "items_qualtrics_format.txt")
```



### Import the items

##### Click the Create New Project button.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ch_qualtrics/images/screenshot_b1.png")
```

#### Select the Survey option.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ch_qualtrics/images/screenshot_b2.png")
```

#### Click the Get Started button.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ch_qualtrics/images/screenshot_b3.png")
```

#### Enter project name, click Create Project

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ch_qualtrics/images/screenshot_b4.png")
```

#### Use the Tools menu to import the items

Select the Import option and then specify the filename for the Advanced Text import file with the items in it.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ch_qualtrics/images/screenshot_b5.png")
```


#### Resulting Survey

The resulting survey for data collection looks like the image below.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ch_qualtrics/images/screenshot_iphone.png")
```

### Tweak survey in Qualtrics




## Qualtrics data to R

Following data collection, you can obtain your data from Qualtrics. As of 2021, Tri-Agency (NSERC, SSHRC, CIHR) [policy](https://www.science.gc.ca/eic/site/063.nsf/eng/h_97610.html) is that data collected with Tri-Agency funded research must be available for reuse by others. The data should follow the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principle. Consequently, when you export the data from Qualtrics (and eventually post it) we want to ensure it has as much information in it as possible. This principle guides the options we select below.

### Export from Qualtrics

#### Click the Data & Analysis tab


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ch_qualtrics/images/screenshot_data.png")
```

##3# Click the Export & Import button.

Then click the **Export Data...** option.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="20%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ch_qualtrics/images/screenshot_export.png")
```


#### Click Use Choice Text

To ensure the data can be used by others, as per the FAIR policy described above, we SELECT the "Use Choice Text" option when exporting data. If you were (non-optimally) select "Use numeric value" as an export option then the resulting data file would be missing information that make it difficult for others to use. Then click the Download button.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ch_qualtrics/images/screenshot_export_choice.png")
```


In doing so we have several goals

* Ensure a workflow that is reproducible. 

* Ensure the data file has as much information as possible - so facilitate reuse by others. 


### Load data in R

### Convert to analytic data
