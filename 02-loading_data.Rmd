# Getting data into R Studio

A large segment of the R community as moved toward a standardized way of naming your columns as desribed in the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org). Likewise, in order to use the tidyverse packages effectively it helps to have [tidy data](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html). In animal or human participant research, however, it can be

### Missing data representation

Before you start entering data, stop and consider how you want to represent missing data. You may want a single missing data code for all data (e.g., -999) or you might want to have a variety of different missing data codes. 

As you do so, be sure to distinguish between codes for missing data and codes for particpants responses such as "Not applicable". Missing data is data that is missing - which is very different that a question being not applicable for a person. This distinction is particularly important if you start to use strategies for estimating the values for missing data (see McKnight et al., 2007). Consider the case of a particpant presented with two questions. The first question asks if they have children and the second question asks the age of their first born child. Imagine the participant indicates they have no children on the first question and then on the second question indicates "No applicable" when asked about the age of their first born child. It would not make sense to treat this "Not applicable" as a missing value and  try to estimate it with missing data strategies. Consequently, when you enter your data (and conduct your analyses) be sure to distinguish missing data from not applicable and similar responses.

### Making a data codebook

Data codebooks are useful because they document the nature of the data in your data file. For example, you might have a column named "ac1" that contains the responses to a Likert-type question. The data codebook could clarify that "ac1" refers an affective commitment item and provide the text of the item. Likewise, sometimes people use value to represent categorical responses in data sets (but try to avoid this practice). In older data it's not uncommon to use 1 to represent male and 2 to represent female (or the other way around). A data codebook clarifies which sex you mean by 1 and which sex you mean by 2. Though as noted previously, you're better off entering "male" and "female" directly into your data file rather than using numerical proxies like 1 and 2.

A data code book is often a spreadsheet that where the rows in the data code book
