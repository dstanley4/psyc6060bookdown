## Required Packages

This chapter requires the following packages are installed:

| Required Packages |
|-------------------|
|apaTables          |
|janitor            |
|psych              |
|tidyverse          |

**Important Note:** that you should NOT use library(psych) at any point. There are major conflict between the psych package and the tidyverse. We will access the psych package command by preceding each command with psych:: instead of using library(psych).

## Objective


## Context

Due to a number of high profile failure to replicate study results [@cos2015] it's become increasely clear that there is a general crisis of confidence in many areas of science [@baker2016]. Statistical (and other) explanations have been offered [@simmons2011] for why it's hard to replicate results across different sets of data. However, scientists are also finding it challenging to recreate the numbers in their papers using their own data. Indeed, the editor of Molecular Brain asked authors to submit the data used to create the numbers in published papers and found that the wrong data was submitted for 40 out of 41 papers [@miyakawa2020].

Consequently, some researchers have suggested that it is critical to distinguish between replication and reproducibility [@patil2019]. Replication refers to trying to obtain the same result from a different data sets. Reproducibility refers to trying to obtain the same results from the same data set. It may seem that reproducibility should be given - but it's not. Correspondingly, there a trend is for journals and authors to adopt Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) [guidelines](https://www.cos.io/our-services/top-guidelines
). These guidelines involve such things as making your materials, data, code, and analysis scripts available on public repositories so anyone can check your data. A new open science journal rating system has even emerged called the [TOP Factor](https://topfactor.org
).

The idea is not that open science articles are  more trustworthy that other types of articles -- the idea is that trust doesn't play a role. Anyone can inspect the data using the scripts and data provided by authors. It's really just the same as making your science available for auditing the way financial records can be audited. The problems reported at Molecular Brain (doubtless is common to many journals) are avoided with open science - because the data and scripts needed to reproduce the numbers in the articles are uploaded prior to publication. 

The TOP open science guidelines have made an impact and some newer journals, such as Meta Psycchology, have fully embraced open science. Figure \@ref(fig:metapsychology) shows the header from an [article](https://open.lnu.se/index.php/metapsychology/article/view/1630/2266) in Meta Psychology that clearly delineates the open science attributes of the article. Take note that the header even specifies who checked that the analyses in the article were reproducible from the scripts and data made publicly available by the authors.

```

In Canada, the majority of university research is funded by the Federal Government's Tri-Agency (i.e., [NSERC](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca), [SSHRC](https://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca), [CIHR](https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca)). The agency has a new draft [Data Management Policy](https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/063.nsf/eng/h_83F7624E.html) in which they state that "**The agencies believe that research data collected with the use of public funds belong, to the fullest extent possible, in the public domain and available for reuse by others.**" This perspective of the funding agency differs from that of some researchers who incorrectly believe "they own their data". In Canada at least, the government makes it clear that tax payers fund the research so the data is public property. Additionally the Tri-Agency Data Management policy clearly indicates the responsibilities of funded researchers:

"Responsibilities of researchers include:

- incorporating data management best practices into their research;
- developing data management plans to guide the responsible collection, formatting, preservation and sharing of their data throughout the entire lifecycle of a research project and beyond;
- following the requirements of applicable institutional and/or funding agency policies and professional or disciplinary standards;
- acknowledging and citing datasets that contribute to their research; and
- staying abreast of standards and expectations of their disciplinary community."

As a result of this perspective on data, it's important that you think about structuring your data for reuse by yourself and others before you collect it. Toward this end, you will see documentation of your data file via data codebooks is critical.


## Begin with the end in mind

In this chapter we will walk you though the steps from data collection, data entry, loading raw data, and the creation of analytic data via preprocessing scripts. These steps are outlined in Figure \@ref(fig:pipeline). This figure makes a clear distinction between raw data and analytic data. Raw data refers to the data as you entered it into a spreadsheet or received it from survey software. Analytic data the data the has been structured and processed so that it is ready for analyis. This pre-processing could include such things as identifying categorical variables to the computer, combining multiple items measuring the same thing into scale scale scores, among other tasks.

It's critial that you don't think of analysis of your results as being completely removed from the data collection and data entry choices you make. Poor choices at the data collection and data entry stage can make your life substantially more complicated when it comes time to write the preprocessing script that will convert your raw data to analytic data. The mantra of this chapter is *begin with the end in mind*.


```{r pipeline, echo = FALSE, out.width="85%", fig.cap = "Data science pipeline by Roger Peng."}
knitr::include_graphics("ch_enter_load/images/pipeline.png")
```


It's difficult to being with the end in mind when you haven't read later chapters. So here we will be provide you with some general thoughts around different approaches to structuring data files and the naming conventions you use when creating those data files.

### Tidydata: Comparing wide vs long formats

When conducting many types of analyses it is necessary to have data in a format called tidydata [@tidy-data]. [Tidydata](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html) as defined by Hadley involves (among other requirements) that: 

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.

The tidydata format can be initially challenging for some researchers to understand because it is based on thinking about, and structuring data, in terms of observations/measurements instead of participants. In this section we will describe common approaches to entering animal and human particpant data and how they can be done keeping the  tidydata requirement in mind. It's not essential that data be entered in a tidydata format but it is essential that you enter data in way that makes it easy to later convert data to a tidydata format.

When dealing with animal or human participant data it's common to enter data into a spreadsheet. Each row of the spreadsheet is typically used to represent a single participant and each column of the spreadshet is used to represent a variable. This approach is relatively straight forward with between participant data. Consider  Table \@ref(tab:betweenex) which illustrates between particpant data for exercise. The first column is id, which indicates there are six unique participants and provides and identification number for each of them. The id is the varible and there is one observation per row - so the id column conforms to tidydata specification. The second column is sex, which is a varible, and there is one observation per for row, so sex also conforms to the tidydata specification. Finally, there is a last column five_km_time which is a variable with one observation per row -- also conforming to tidydata specification. Thus, single occasion between subject data like this conforms to the tidydata specification.


```{r betweenex, echo = FALSE}
data_between <- read_csv("data_ex_between.csv", col_type = cols())
knitr::kable(
  head(data_between), caption = 'Between participant data entered one row per participant',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```


Within particpant data can be substantially more complicated than between participant data. Consider the a similar example with five km times over .... see Table \@ref(tab:withinex).
more aobut the example


```{r withinex, echo = FALSE}
data_within <- read_csv("data_ex_within.csv", col_types = cols())
knitr::kable(
  head(data_within), caption = 'Within participant data entered one row per participant',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
data_within_tidy <- data_within %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = march:july,
               names_to = "measurement_month",
               values_to =  "five_km_time")

```

| Problems with within participant data in Table \@ref(tab:withinex) |
| -------------------------------------------------------------|
| Actually a mix of between (e.g., sex) and within data (times)|
| Multiple 5km times per row - not a single 5km time per row  |
| Unclear what the measured variable is in the march, may, july columns |
| Levels of the variable occasion (march, etc) are represented in headers instead of rows |
| more |




Figure XX shows the first few rows of a between participant data set 
to use an approach based on the principle of one participant per row in a data file. 
That is data files are structured so that

# Collecting your data

- data are collected in different ways
- data collected by programs in the lab that require 
- lab measurementson paper and entering later
- paper surveys and entering later
- website surveys 
- a mix of all of the above

each trial is a row - multiple rows per person...

Distinguish between entering data and not. But also think about what's not confusing...
talk about wide not showing DV or IV just levels of IV


if you're writing a cognitive program or making a survey think about the variable names
think about how the data is outputed.


If you have entirely within person data then tidy is the obvious choice
If you have entirely between then wide makes sense
If you have a mix - it's more difficult. Different research area. Think about the problems. 

For example, a good data code book is essential if you have wide with repeated measures varibles because there is no way to tell what the IV or DV is by inspecting the data.




TIDYVERSE NAMING CONVENTION ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IN SOME CASES THEY ARE REQUIRED for the SCRIPTS to work. If you haven't following the naming conventions you may be making your life quite difficult.

## Begin with a project

I suggest you begin every R Studio task in the following way:

R Studio in the Cloud
1. Create a new Project using the web interface
2. Upload your data files in using the upload button in the Files pane

R Studio on Your Computer
1. Create a folder on your computer for the analysis
2. Place your data files in that folder
3. Use the menu item File > New Project... to start the project
4. On the window that appears select "Existing Directory"
5. On the next screen, press the "Browse" button and find/select the folder with your data
6. Press the Create Project Button

Regardless of whether your are working from the cloud or locally you should now have an R Studio project with your data files in it. Using Projects.

**Class note: You dont' need to do either of these approach. You will just "Start" each assignment in the class workspace on R Studio Cloud".**

## Raw data

We begin by examining the data as originally entered into a spreadsheet. In Figure \@ref(fig:rawdataitems) you see a screen shot of the intial raw data as a researcher might receive it. Take careful note of the numerous -999 values used to indicate missing values. As part of creating the analytic data that we will analyze we need to indicate to the computer that the -999 are not data but codes to represent missing values.


```{r rawdataitems, echo = FALSE, out.width="85%", fig.cap = "Raw data for item scoring"}
knitr::include_graphics("ch_score_items/images/screenshot_raw_data.png")
```

## Loading raw data

Create an  RStudio project for this activity 
Create a new script in your project and save it wite

```{r, results='hide'}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)

my_missing_value_codes <- c("-999", "", "NA")

raw_data <- read_csv(file = "data_item_scoring.csv",
                     na = my_missing_value_codes)
```




## Initial inspection

We use glimipse to do an initial inspection of the column names in this data set. All of the column name conform to [tidyverse style guidelines](https://style.tidyverse.org) so we do not need to run the clean_name() function from the janitor package


```{r}
glimpse(raw_data)
```


```{r, eval = FALSE}
view(raw_data)
```

See Figure \@ref(fig:narawdataitems)

```{r narawdataitems, echo = FALSE, out.width="85%", fig.cap = "Missing values now NA"}
knitr::include_graphics("ch_score_items/images/screenshot_raw_data_na.png")
```


## Handling categorical variables

```{r}

# Turn all columns that are of type character into factors
raw_data <- raw_data %>%
  mutate(across(.cols = where(is.character),
                .fns = as.factor))

```

We can see there was only one column that changes, but if there had been many columns that were characters they all would have changed.

```{r}
glimpse(raw_data)
```

It's often helpful to has id as a factor rather than a number so we add and extra command that changes this value:

```{r}
raw_data <-raw_data %>%
  mutate(id = as.factor(id))
```

Now it looks like our data is ready for the creation of scale scores:

```{r}
glimpse(raw_data)
```




## Seeing your data

See the first six rows of the data with the *head* command below. If you wanted to see all of the data you would use View(raw_data). The NA values in the output indicate missing values (NA = Not Available).
```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
head(raw_data)
```


## Dealing with reverse key items

Our first step is dealing with reverse key items. The way you deal with these items depends on how you scored them. Imagine you had a 5-point scale. You could have scored the scale with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Alternatively, you could have scored the scale with the values 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. In this example, we scored the data using the 1 to 5 system. So we'll use that. Later I'll show you how to deal with the other scoring system (0 to 4).

### Scoring items where the ratings scale starts with 1
We need to take items that were reversed-key when the participant wrote them and recode those responses. We do that with using the *mutate* command from the *dplyr* package.

In this data file the only reverse-key item was SE7 (we known this from when we created the survey). We use the command below to reverse key an item with reponse options ranging from 1 to 5. So we use 6 in the command (i.e., one higher than 5).

```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
raw_data <-raw_data %>%
  mutate(SE7c = 6 - SE7)
```
The command above creates a new column in raw_data called SE7c that has the reverse-keyed values for SE7 in it.  You can see the new SE7c column using command below that displays the first six rows of the data. The SE7c column is at the far right of the data displayed.

```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
glimpse(raw_data)
```

We have reverse keyed one item. So now when we create our scale we will use item SE7c (the c stands for correctly coded) instead of the original item SE7. That is, we will use items SE1, SE2, SE3, SE4, SE5, SE6, **SE7c**, SE8, SE9, and SE10 to form the scale.


**Note for a box** multiple items what it looks like

**Note FOR A BOX **. If you had used response options numbered 0 to 4 for each item you would use the command below instead. Note that we use 4 in the command this time instead of a value one higher.
```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
raw_data <- mutate(raw_data, SE7c = 4 - SE7) 
```


## Creating the scale score

```{r}
raw_data <- raw_data %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(self_esteem = mean(c(SE1, SE2, SE3, SE4, SE5, SE6, SE7c, SE8, SE9, SE10),
                            na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

When you see ungroup() in ths context you can think of it as "turn off rowwise".


We can see our data now has the self esteem column:

```{r}
glimpse(raw_data)
```

(Alternative code: removing ITEM 7 and using begings with: show full example)
Think about this when creating names for your column


## Creatinig analytic data from raw data

Select only the columns you will use in your analysis:
```{r}
analytic_data <- raw_data %>%
  select(id, age, sex, self_esteem)
```

We can see our new data set has only these columns of interest:
```{r}
glimpse(analytic_data)
```


## Wait: I need alpha!

We return to the raw_data file that has the original item data to obtain Cronbach's alpha which is labeled "raw alpha" in the output.


```{r}
self_esteem_item_analysis <- raw_data %>%
  select(SE1, SE2, SE3, SE4, SE5, SE6, SE7c, SE8, SE9, SE10) %>%
  psych::alpha()

print(self_esteem_item_analysis$total)

# To see the full item analysis use:
# print(self_esteem_item_analysis)
```


## Wait: I need item correlations and descriptive statistics


```{r, eval = FALSE}
SE_items <- raw_data %>% 
  select(starts_with("SE", ignore.case = FALSE))

psych::describe(SE_items)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
SE_items <- raw_data %>% 
  select(starts_with("SE", ignore.case = FALSE))
psych::describe(SE_items)[,1:5]
```


When you run the cor command you have to indicate how the it will handle missing the data. The options are below. You can learn more about what each one of these options means  by typing: **?cor** into the Console, this will bring up the help page for the cor command.

|Missing data options for cor  |
|-----------------------|
| everything            |
| all.obs               |
| complete.obs          |
| na.or.complete        |
| pairwise.complete.obs |

```{r}
SE_items %>%
  cor(use = "pairwise.complete.obs") %>%
  round(2)
```



```{r, include=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
desc_summary <- list(
  mean  = ~mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE), 
  sd    = ~sd(.x, na.rm = TRUE),
  min   = ~min(.x, na.rm = TRUE),
  max   = ~max(.x, na.rm = TRUE)
)

numeric_data <- raw_data %>% select(where(is.numeric)) %>% select(-self_esteem)

row_sum <- numeric_data %>% summarise(across(everything(), desc_summary), sep = c("z"))

long_summary <- row_sum %>% pivot_longer(cols = everything(),
                        names_to = c("var", "stat"),
                        names_sep = c("z"),
                        values_to = "value")

wide_summary <- long_summary %>% pivot_wider(names_from = stat,
                                 values_from = value)

print(wide_summary)
  



```


```{r, include=FALSE, eval = FALSE}

x <- raw_data %>% summarise(across(starts_with("SE", ignore.case = FALSE), 
                              desc_summary)) 


y <- x %>% pivot_longer(cols = everything(),
                   names_to = c("var", "stat"),
                   names_sep = c("_"),
                   values_to = "value")

y %>% pivot_wider(names_from = stat,
                  values_from = value)

```

```{r, include=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
y %>% pivot_wider(names_from = stat,
                  values_from = value)
```





## Using R the old way or the new way (the tidyverse way) 


Previously we noted that there is an older way of using R (base R) and the new way of using R (the tidyverse) that we will use. Sometimes students have problems with their code when they mix and match these appoaches using a bit of both. We will be using the tidyverse approach to using R but on the internet you will often see sample code that uses the older base R approach. A bit of background knowledge is helpful for understanding why we do things one way (e.g., read_csv with the tidyverse) instead of another (e.g., read.csv with base R). 

#### Tibbles vs Data Frames: Why use read_csv instead of read.csv

When you load data into R it is typically represented in one of two formats inside the computer - depending on the command you used. The original format for representing a data set in R is the data frame. You will see this term used frequently when you read about R. When you load data using read.csv your data is loaded into a data frame in the computer. That is your data is represented in the memory of the computer in particular format and structure called a data frame.

#### read.csv puts data into a data frame
```{r}
my_dataframe <- read.csv(file = "data_okcupid.csv")

```

Notice that when you print a data frame it does NOT show you the number of rows or columns above the data like our example did with the okcupid_profiles data. It also list ALL of your data rather than just the first few rows. As a result in the output below I show only the first 10 rows of the output - because all the rows are printed in your Console (too much to show here).
```{r, eval = FALSE}
print(my_dataframe)
```

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
print(my_dataframe[1:10, ])
```

#### read_csv puts data into a tibble

When you use the read_csv command the data you load is stored in the computer as a tibble. The tibble is modern version of the data frame. Notice that when you print a tibble it DOES show you the number of rows and columns.  As well, the tibble only provides the first few rows of output so it doesn't fill your screen.


```{r}
my_tibble <- read_csv(file = "data_okcupid.csv")

```
```{r}
print(my_tibble)
```

#### Deeper differences between data frames and tibbles

In short you should always use tibbles (i.e., use read_csv) - they are simply enhanced data frames (i.e., the new version of the data frame). The differences between data frames and tibbles run deeper than the superficial output provided here. On some rare occasions an old package or command may not work with a tibble so you need to make it a data frame. You can do so with the commands below:

#### Converting a tibble into a data frame

This command creates a new data set called new_data_frame (use any name you want) from the tibble data.

```{r}
new_dataframe <- as.data.frame(my_tibble)
```
