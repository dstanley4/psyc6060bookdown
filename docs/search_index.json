In an ANOVA you can have two variables interact to predict a dependent variable. In this ANOVA scenario, the predictors are the categorical ANOVA variables. When our predictors are continuous variables (e.g., height, weight, etc) they can still interact to predict the dependent variable (i.e., criterion). In this chapter we primarily focus on how to obtain the required information from R to write up a continous variable interaction (also known as a moderated multiple regression). For an understanding of the underlying theory I strongly encourage you to read Chapter 7: Interactions among continuous variables in Cohen, Cohen, West, and Aiken (2003): Cohen, J., Cohen, P., West, S. G., &amp; Aiken, L. S. (2013). Applied multiple regression/correlation analysis for the behavioral sciences. Routledge. 18.2 Scenario Imagine a scenario where we are interested in predicted endurance from participant age and exercise. We can load the data: library(tidyverse) data_endurance &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data_endurance.csv&quot;) We can see the structure of the data: glimpse(data_endurance) ## Rows: 245 ## Columns: 4 ## $ id &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, … ## $ age &lt;dbl&gt; 60, 40, 29, 47, 48, 42, 55, 43, 39, 51, 54, 52, 53, 68, 57,… ## $ exercise &lt;dbl&gt; 10, 9, 2, 10, 9, 6, 8, 19, 9, 14, 15, 4, 3, 17, 24, 4, 4, 1… ## $ endurance &lt;dbl&gt; 18, 36, 51, 18, 23, 30, 8, 40, 28, 15, 49, 27, 12, 43, 47, … 18.3 Overview 18.3.1 No interaction \\[ \\hat{Y} = b_0 + b_1age + b_2exercise \\] lm_no_int &lt;- lm(endurance ~ age + exercise, data = data_endurance) 18.3.2 Interaction \\[ \\hat{Y} = b_0 + b_1age + b_2exercise + b_3(age)(exercise)\\] lm_int &lt;- lm(endurance ~ age + exercise + I(age*exercise), data = data_endurance) 18.3.3 Comparison 18.4 fastInteraction We want to conduct the regression below: \\[ \\hat{Y} = b_0 + b_1age + b_2exercise + b_3(age)(exercise)\\] The fast.int() command in the fastInteraction package does the following: Centers variables if requested Conducts the regression (i.e., the lm command) Creates the 2D graph Creates the 3D graph Creates two APA style tables to describe the analyses library(fastInteraction) new_axis_labels &lt;- list(criterion = &quot;Endurance&quot;, predictor = &quot;Age (centered)&quot;, moderator = &quot;Exercise (centered)&quot;) mmr_output &lt;- fast.int(data = cohen_exercise, criterion = endurance, predictor = age, moderator = exercise, center.predictors = TRUE, axis.labels = new_axis_labels, path = &quot;tables_mmr.doc&quot;) 18.4.1 Graphing in 3D mmr_output$graph3D ## Warning: `arrange_()` is deprecated as of dplyr 0.7.0. ## Please use `arrange()` instead. ## See vignette(&#39;programming&#39;) for more help ## This warning is displayed once every 8 hours. ## Call `lifecycle::last_warnings()` to see where this warning was generated. 18.4.2 Unformatted 2D graph unformatted_ggplot_graph &lt;- mmr_output$graph2D.unformatted print(unformatted_ggplot_graph) 18.4.3 Tables We inspect MS Word file created by the fast.int() command below. It presents the results of the various regression in tables corresponding to APA style. 18.4.4 Formatted 2D graph We inspect the Table output and find the value for -1/+1 SD of the moderator (age). In this case, we find the value is 4.775. So we use this to set the x-axis labels. That way the ticks on the x-axis correspond to standard deviations. custom_formatted_ggplot_graph &lt;- unformatted_ggplot_graph + coord_cartesian(ylim = c(10, 40)) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(10, 40, by = 5)) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-4.775*2, 4.775*2, by = 4.775)) + labs(x = &quot;Exercise (centered)&quot;, y = &quot;Endurance&quot;, linetype = &quot;Age (centered)&quot;) + theme_classic(18) print(custom_formatted_ggplot_graph) 18.4.4.1 Saving ggsave(&quot;graph_2D_interaction.png&quot;, custom_formatted_ggplot_graph) "]]
