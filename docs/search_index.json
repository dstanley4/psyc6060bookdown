We can access R Studio using the website R Studio Cloud. 1.1 A focus on workflow and the tidyverse A key focus on this course is training you in a workflow that will avoid a large number of problms than can occur when using R. As well, the R code used through this text will focus primarily on a workflow using the contemporary tidyverse packages rather than the older base R approach. We’ll further discuss the distinction between the tidyverse and base R later in this chapter. 1.2 R works with plug-in / add-ons R is a statistical language with many plug-ins called packages that you will use to do analyses. You can think of R as being like your smartphone. To do things with your phone you need an App (R equivalent is a package). Before you can use the App you need to download it (R equivalent is to install.packages) from the App Store (R equivalent is the CRAN). To use the app you need Open it (R equivalent is the library command). These similarities are illustrated in Table @ref(tab:app_store). (#tab:app_store)R packages can be conceptualized using smart phone terminology (Kim, 2018).
