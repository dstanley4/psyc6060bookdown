The mean height of all 50,000 students is 172.50 and the variance is 156.3236 The heights of all the university students are illustrated in Figure 1A. This figure is shaded with stick figures wearing trousers that remind us this distribution represents people. The mean of the population people’s heights (in cm) is calculated as below (where N = 50,000). \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\mu_{people} &amp;= \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N=50000}{X_i}}{N}\\\\ &amp;= 172.50\\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] The variance of the population people’s heights (in cm) is calculated as below (where N = 50,000). \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\sigma_{people}^2 &amp;= \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N=50000}{(X_i - \\bar{X})^2}}{N}\\\\ &amp;= 156.3236\\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] 14.1 Random sampling process Now imagine that we are interested in studying the random sampling process. Specifically we are interested in examining the variability in sample means that occurs when taking random samples of students from the university. Indeed, imagine that we obtained a sample of \\(n\\) = 25 students and calculated a sample mean (\\(\\bar{x}\\)). Then we repeated this sampling process an infinite number of times such that we have a infinite number of sample means. This set of an infinite number of sample means is conceptually illustrated in Figure 1B and we refer to it as the sampling distribution of the mean. Moreover, because we sampled from a single population the variability in sample means is due only to the random sampling error that occurs when the sample size is 25 and the population variance is YY. [Figure 1A and 1B goes here] 14.2 Population: What’s in a name Typically, in psychology, when we use the word “population” we are referring to a population of people - such as those illustrated in Figure 1A. However, in statistics, a population is simply set of elements (often people) about which we wish to draw conclusions. In this chapter, we shift our focus from thinking of the distribution of people in Figure 1A as a population to also thinking of the distribution of sample mean in Figure 1B as a population. Doing so may seem counter intuitive but it the logical foundation for Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). 14.2.1 Distribution of sample means as a population Since we are thinking of the distribution of sample means as a population we can calculate a mean and variance for the distribution of sample means. The mean of the population of sample means is calculated as below. To make things a bit easier to follow we use \\(A\\) instead of \\(N\\) to represent the number of sample means (where \\(A\\) = infinity, because there are an infinite number of sample means in the distribution)1 \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\mu_{\\bar{x}} &amp;= \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{A=\\infty}{\\bar{x}_i}}{A}\\\\ &amp;= 172.50\\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] The mean of the sample means, \\(\\mu_{\\bar{x}}\\), will always be the same as that of the individuals heights, \\(\\mu_{people}\\). Consequently, any conclusions we make about population means based on Figure 1B will also apply to Figure 1A. This is a crucial point to keep in mind as we proceed through this chapter. Although we are ultimately interested in making conclusion about the mean of the people - all our work in this chapter (and in ANOVA) is based on the distribution of sample mean in Figure 1B. We just need to remember that any conclusion we make about the population mean in Figure 1B will also apply to Figure 1A – because with sample means the two distributions will always have the same mean. 14.3 Variance of the distribution of sampling means When there is only one population of people there are two approaches to calculating the variance of the resulting population of sample means that will produce the same result. 14.3.1 Calculate the variance of infinite sample means In this first approach, we use an infinite number of sample means and simply calculate the variance. Obviously, this is an impractical solution because we could never obtain an infite number of samples and then calculate the variance for each sample. Conceptually, however, it’s good to keep this calculation approach in mind - since it reminds us of principles we’ve already learned about the variance of populations2 \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\sigma_{\\bar{x}}^2 &amp;= \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{A=\\infty}{(\\bar{x}_i - \\bar{\\bar{x}})^2}}{A}\\\\ &amp;= 6.252944\\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] Notice how this is similar to population formula when we are dealing with people. This formula differs for the typical formula because we are using on sample means (\\(\\bar{x}\\)) instead of attributes of people (\\(X\\)). As well, we just use \\(A\\) to indicate the number of elements used in the calculation rather than \\(N\\). When there is only one population this formula will reflect variability in sample means due to random sampling. When there is more than one population - it becomes more complicated. We’ll discuss that situation in a future chapter. 14.3.2 CLT Shortcut with variance and sample size Fortunately we don’t need to obtain an infinite number of sample means to determine the variance of the distribution of an infinite number of sample means. There is a “shortcut formula” we can used based on the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). More specifically, the variance of the distribution of sample means depends on both the number of people in each sample (\\(n\\)) and the variability in the people’s heights in the population (\\(\\sigma_{people}^2\\)). \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\sigma_{\\bar{x}}^2 &amp;= \\frac{\\sigma_{people}^2}{n}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{156.3236}{25}\\\\ &amp;= 6.252944\\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] The reason this formula works should not be obvious - at all. If you are looking at this formula trying to figure out why it works - I suggest you stop and just accept that it does work. If you want to understand why it works, I suggest you consult (Hays 1994) who provides a statistical proof for the Central Limit Theorem. It’s helpful, moving forward to, think of this formula (\\(\\frac{\\sigma_{people}^2}{n}\\)) as representing the variability due to random sample. No matter the situation - this formula will always reflect the variability in sample means due ONLY to random sampling. 14.3.3 Ratio comparison of two approaches Show ratio is one. When you have all elements of the population these two approaches will produce exactly the same result. Obviously, neither can be used to determine the variance per se with real world data. The fist because can’t use an infinite number of samples and the second because we can’t know the population variance. However, as we see below they both can we used to estimate the variance of the distribution of sample means. Show ratio with formulas and numbers 14.4 Estimating variance of the distribution of sampling means 14.4.1 Calculate the variance of a set of sample means If we obtain a set of sample means from this population of sample means (i.e., distribution of sample mean) we can use those to estimate the variance of the distribution of sample mean. We use the lower case “a” to represent the number of sample means. Recall, the when we use a subset of the elements of the population (i.e., population of sample means) to estimate the variance of the full population we need to use a “-1” in the denominator - see previous chapter. (Show formula with a -1) Imagine that we have 3 sample means (each based on n = 25) that we use to estimate the variance of the population of sample means (i.e., estimate the variance of the distribution of sample means). (Formula for mean) (Formula for variance) Sample 1 : mean and estimated population variance Sample 2 : mean and estimated population variance Sample 3 : mean and estimated population variance So our estimate of the variance of distribution of sample means is presented below. (Show formula with a -1) with plugged in values. Thus, our estimated variance of the distribution of sample means is the following: 14.4.2 CLT Shortcut with estimated variance and sample size Recall, than an alternative to calculating the variance of the distribution of sample means is to use the shortcut formula based on central limit theorem. That formula is presented below. The problem with this formula is that you need to know the variance of the all the people in the population - and we don’t know the variance of all the people in the population. But, we do have three samples from that population of people. Because the three samples are from the same population of people - we know each sample provides an estimate of the same (single) variance of people in the population. Therefore, we can combine those variance estimates into better (or average) estimate of the variance of the people in the population using the formula below. (Pooling formula) We use different names to refer to the resulting number - we could just call it a better estimate of the population variance. But statisticians also use the names pooled variance of mean squared error for this term. It’s important to know that when the sample sizes are equal it’s the average of the variances… We’ll use the notation s2mse to refer to this estimate of the variance of the people. Armed with the estimate of the variance of the people in the population we can use the CLT shortcut formula to obtain an estimate of the variance of the distribution of sample means. (Show clt shortcut with variance estimate here). 14.4.3 Ratio comparison of two approaches We revisit the ratio comparison approach and see that we are using estimates that the But on average it will be one. See this simulation with 6 cols (m/var est), 2 col (both calcs), 1 col ratio. When everything comes from 1 population on average….. Show ratio with formulas and numbers 14.5 Walk away points Sometimes we need to shift our thinking and conceptualize the distribution of sample means as the population to which we are trying to generalize think of var/n as representing the variability in sample means due to random sampling the findings we illustrate here only hold when there is only one population the sample means come from that one population.
